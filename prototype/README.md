## [WIP] Sudoku solver with Python
This portion of code is under a development.
You can think of this as a sandbox for now.

To run the program, simply type the following:
```bash
$python run.py
```

This will read in `sudoku.jpg` file, solve the problem, and save into `answer.jpg`.
Currently, we have many functions returning dummy blobs.
Many things are hard-coded.
We expect to deliever fully-loaded solver by 2016-04-31.
